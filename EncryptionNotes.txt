Cipher is a system used to create an encoded or secret message

A simple scenario (called ceaser cipher)

A message has to be delivered , agreed upon rule is that each letter will be shifted 6 times, that is A=G
shifting of character is the encryption, if the recipient has the key (A=G) he can decrypt the message
CIA Triad, Confidentiality, Integrity(complete) and Availability.
A good security plan incorporates all of CIA, example. Too much Availability will compromise confidentiality.


Confidentilaity
==============
- File encryption
-Message encryption
- Link encryption

Integrity
===========

Hashes and Digital signatures is used to help verify message and its origin or to detect corruption in file.
stronger encryption will take longer time to encrypt/decrypt message and could affect integrity 

Availability
============


Symmetric cryptography
it uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the message (example ceaser chipher, both encryption and decryption process has to know that A=G

Assymetric cryptography

It uses two different keys, one for encryption and other for decryption.


A is sender and B is reciever.
A will encryption B's public key to encrypt /cipher his message and send to B.
B will use its private key to decrypt/decipher the message
