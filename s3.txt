Create bucket options
=======================

When you create new bucket it's access is restricted by default.  you have to edit its public access settings and remove restrictions. 
If you don't do so and try to give public access to objects inside bucket, it won't work.

buckets are universal name space
successful upload of object returns http 200 code.

once you enable versioning on bucket , you cannot disable it, you can suspend it though.

Replication can be done only cross region , not in the same region.
after replication configuration you have to copy already built in objects using cli commands
afterwards uploading new versions automatically replicates, except deletion (for security reasons)

exam tips
versioning must be enabled on source and destination buckets.
regions must be unique
files in existing bucket not replicated automatically, subsequent uploads do (exept any deletion may it be object or version).
cannot replicate to multiple buckets

s3 lifecycle and glacier notes
can be used in conjunction with versionining.
can be applied to current version and previous versions.
following things can be done
 - Transition to standard : Infrequent Access Storage class (30 days after the creation)
 - Archive to glacier storage class (30 days after IA if relevant)
 -Permanently delete

Edge locations are not read only, you can write objects on them too.
Objects are cached for the life of TTL(Time to leave)
