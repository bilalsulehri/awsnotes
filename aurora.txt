Aurora is compatible with MySql and postgresql, 5 times faster than mysql or 3 times faster than postgresql
- distributed , fault tolerance, self healing storage system , that autoscales up to 64 TB using SSD per database cluster
- IN order to get high availability advantage of Aurora, you need to set it up in Multi AZ
- provisioned storage increases automatically with need
- can have upto 15 read replicas
- offers 99.99% availability
- replicates to 6 copies accross 3 availability zones
- backups are stored on s3
-failover occurs in less than 30 seconds
-since it's mysql and postgresql compatible, migration to them is easy.

Why Aurora?
- Relational databases are expensive
-scaling options are usually vertical for RDBMS
- you can take existing mysql and postgresql database and migrate it to aurora easily

what Aurora Looks like?
-It replicates across 3 AZ in 10GB chunks
-it uses a shared storage volume, when chunks is written on that shared volume, it replicates each chunk, two times on each AZ
  so it'll make 6 copies of each chunk in total
-Aurora has 4/6 write quorum and 3/6 read quorum, which means that if 6 out of 4 nodes acknowledge the write operation, the write is considered stable, and remaining two are eventually also copied.  3/6 read means, if 3 out of 6 returns data, it's considered good.

Limitations
==========

1. Aurora cluster volumes can grow up to 64 TB, need support ticket to raise limit
2. provision upto 15 read replicas per cluster
3. Largest Instance : 64 vCPU, 488 GB RAM, (db.r4.16xlarge)
4. backtrack window can go back up to 72 hours
5. compatible with my sql 5.6.10 , 5.7.12
