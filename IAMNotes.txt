-IAM supports PCI DSS
-Policy are permissions ,documents are JSON formatted.
-Anything you create on IAM, it's on global region basis, it's not for any particular region

what's SAML
Using SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0), you can give your federated users single sign-on (SSO) access to the AWS Management Console.

AWS follows least privilige scheme, which means user created have no access, and for example s3 bucket have no public access

Power user have access to all aws service except the management of groups and users within IAM

when we create user, by default no permission is given to user it's called non-explicit deny

best practice is to create an IAM user and login through it for daily work, and not use the root user

pricipal of least priviledge should be practiced while creating iam users

Policies
two kinds, explicit allow and explicit deny
explicit deny always overrides explicit allows

Roles are used for services, because policies cannot be attached to services
