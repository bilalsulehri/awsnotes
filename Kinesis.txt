Kinesis
Kinesis Streams stores data for 24 hrs, but you can increase it to 7 days.
data is stored in shards inside kinesis stream.
the consumer for data in shards will be ec2 instances
once consumers have done calculations on data, it can be send to be stored in variety of database services.

Kinesis consists of shards, which 

A shard is a unit of throughput capacity. Each shard ingests up to 1MB/sec and 1000 records/sec, and emits up to 2MB/sec. To accommodate for higher or lower throughput, the number of shards can be modified after the Kinesis stream is created using the API

A shard can process limited number of requests , so use more shards

List stream command : aws kinesis list-streams

aws kinesis describe-stream --stream-name test-stream 
Above command describes things about stream, like no. of shards and their ids and other configs.

aws kinesis put-record --stream-name test-stream --partition-key 4 --data  4  
Above command is used to write data into stream


In order to read data from stream, first you need to know the shard id, then  get the shard-iterator out of it, there are different number of types for iterator, TRIM_HORIZON starts from begininning
after getting shard iterator get-records is used to get record out of it, if limit has been used then it gives the next shard iterator id to read more from it.(see following two commands)

aws kinesis get-shard-iterator --stream-name test-stream --shard-iterator-type TRIM_HORIZON --shard-id shardId-000000000000 
aws kinesis get-records --shard-iterator AAAAAAAAAAEC9y4iCV3MaXOxjkcfZviAfm9Vvd02nuB3jbebz9fCzvtB7PL/T5KNWI5ACP+E8xm87KCFqYe0bJz2NiVCoyFA7zbTHaorrnPVNNCw87WpP92m000NoW/6ttRl3CI5X9S2GM6NJV1Saob4HErKbjwdd0RRBnnI+HH+8ZAsbnQSV1LP1npG98NfR17T1svHVh8QD+gBgUL1baMtaujt2UBo


Kinesis provides different methods to scale shards up and down
- SplitShard
-Merge Shards
- UpdateShardCount (scale up and down to particular number
