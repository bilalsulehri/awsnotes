created vpc with CIDR : 10.0.0.0/16
created subnet 10.0.1.0/24 us-east-1a in above vpc
created subnet 10.0.2.0/24 us-east-1b in above vpc
created internet gateway in above vpc
creatd a route table with following rule and associated it with 1a
0.0.0.0/0 	target : internet gateway
::/0	(ip6)

for the public subnet, change the auto ip assigning setting to yes


by doing this, now the subnet 1a is public and 1b is private.

created two ec2s, one in public subnet and other in private
and tried to install things on both

in order to instance in private subnet to get access to internet, we add NAT instance or NAT gateway 
and in the main route table, we add route entry for it.

Eeach ec2 instance performs source and destination check by default. this means that instance must be source or destination of any traffic it receives. However, a NAT instance must be able to send and receive traffic, when the source or destination is not itself. therefore you must disable source/destination check on nat instance

NAT instance should have http, https enabled in order for internet traffic 

note: ephemeral port is short lived port for communication 	e.g. 1024-65535
